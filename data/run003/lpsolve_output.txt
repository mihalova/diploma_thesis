Using DUAL simplex for phase 1 and PRIMAL simplex for phase 2.
The primal and dual simplex pricing strategy set to 'Devex'.
 
Found feasibility by dual simplex after             3 iter.
 
Optimal solution             0.31959 after          4 iter.

Relative numeric accuracy ||*|| = 0

 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.2.5 for 64 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 4, 0 (0.0%) were bound flips.
      There were 2 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 0 by density.
       ... on average 2.0 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 23 NZ entries, 1.0x largest basis.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 2, with a dynamic range of 2.
      Time to load data was 0.001 seconds, presolve used 0.000 seconds,
       ... 0.002 seconds in simplex solver, in total 0.003 seconds.
