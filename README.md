# Software for isometric gene tree reconciliation 
The goal of this thesis is to implement a practical software for isometric gene tree reconciliation and to evaluate its accuracy on simulated as well as real biological data.

This thesis and source code is based on master's thesis of Radoslav Chládek: Algorithms for isometric gene tree reconciliation (Univerzita Komenského v Bratislave, 2019). 

## Content
Project have two folders and one file:
* data - contains scripts for testing the reconciliation software
* latex_diploma_thesis - contains actual version of thesis (all latex files, pdf file and figures)
* reconciliation_software - contains cource code in Java of the reconciliation software
* presentation - contains progress of my work for class: Project seminar 1
* presentation_new - contains progress of my work for class: Project seminar 2

## Timeline - to do
#### 18. 12. 2020
* change the implementation of "counting algorithm" - counts evolutionary events inside node *u* and on the edge between node *u* and its parent *v*
#### 30. 11. 2020
* implement "counting algorithm"
#### 04. 11. 2020
* implement "rooting the gene tree" algorithm
#### 09. 10. 2020
* overview of gathered literature, choosing testing data
#### 11. 06. 2020
* gather literature and information about software and experiments
